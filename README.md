Hi, I'm a CGI student in my last year at ESMA Montpellier.
I specialize in programming with python for Maya, Nuke and more.
I like to create tools to make the artist's workflow easier.


I enjoy working with Maya, Nuke and Houdini.


I'm great with problem solving and finding solutions for each new obstacle that can arise in specific projects. I'm here to make things possible.

The most important to me is to learn every day.

This year I worked on my graduation movie with 7 precious mates. I was Technical Director and I really enjoyed coming up with solutions to bring ideas from other departments to life.
I shared my tools with the other students, they were used on 6 movies and by 40 artists on campus (I have shared my work to other campuses but I donâ€™t know how many people used my tools.) I think sharing and helping are the key values to working as a team. 

I have also been in charge of the renderfarm, by creating scripts and communicating issues with the IT.
