Hi, I'm a CGI student in my last year at ESMA Montpellier.
I specialize in programming such as python for maya, nuke.
I like to create tools to make the artist's workflow easier.


I enjoy working with Maya, nuke and houdini and programming in python.


I'm great with problem solving and finding solutions for each new problem that can arise in specific projects. 
I like to find solutions to make things possible.


The most important thing for me is to learn new things every day.

This year I worked on my graduation movie with 7 precious mates.
I was Technical Director and I really enjoyed finding solutions and making concrete ideas from other departments.

I shared my tools with other students, they were used on 6 movies and by 40 artist’s in the same campus (I have shared to other campuses but I don’t know how many people used my tools.)
I never capitalize on my tools because my reward is the idea that these tools are useful.
I think sharing and helping are the most important values for working as a team.
